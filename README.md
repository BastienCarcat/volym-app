# Volym - Science-Based Program Builder for Advanced Lifters

> The only tool that helps advanced lifters create structured, scientifically-optimized training programs without paying a coach.

---

## The Problem

### Target Audience: Advanced Autonomous Lifters

**Who they are:**
- 3-5+ years of training experience
- Solid knowledge of training principles (volume landmarks, periodization, RIR, progressive overload)
- Can't afford or don't want a coach ($150-300/month)
- Want to program for themselves but lack the right tools

**Their Pain Points:**

1. **Time-consuming program creation**
   - Takes 4-6 hours to build a proper 12-week program in Excel/Notion
   - Constant second-guessing ("Is this volume optimal? Am I balanced?")
   - No validation tools to confirm program quality

2. **Training "by feel" leads to stagnation**
   - Same exercises week after week
   - Random volume progression (too much or too little)
   - No real periodization strategy
   - Results plateau after 1-2 years

3. **Existing tools don't fit their needs**
   - **Strong/Hevy**: Great for tracking, zero creation intelligence
   - **AI generators (Fitbod, JEFIT AI)**: Black box solutions for beginners, no control
   - **Strivee/TrueCoach**: Built for coaches, not solo lifters
   - **Excel/Notion**: Full control but no intelligence, takes forever

4. **Knowledge-to-execution gap**
   - They know the theory (MEV, MRV, SFR, undulating periodization)
   - But translating it into a coherent 12-week program is overwhelming
   - No feedback loop to validate decisions

**Current "solutions" and why they fail:**

| Solution | Cost | Problem |
|----------|------|---------|
| Hire a coach | $150-300/month | Too expensive, want to learn themselves |
| Excel/Notion | Free | 6+ hours per program, no validation |
| Strong/Hevy | $10/month | Just tracking, no program intelligence |
| AI generators | $15/month | No control, beginner-focused, black box |
| Strivee | $52/month | Built for coaches managing clients |

**Result:** They train suboptimally, plateau, and waste their potential.

## The Solution: Volym

**Value Proposition:**
> "Build coach-quality programs in 30 minutes with science-based validation - no coach required."

**How it works:**
1. **Create** your program structure (workouts, exercises, sets/reps)
2. **Validate** with intelligent analytics (volume, balance, periodization)
3. **Optimize** based on science-backed recommendations
4. **Execute** with clean PDF exports or mobile integration

**Core Philosophy:**
- You stay in control (not AI black box)
- We provide intelligence (not just spreadsheets)
- Science-based validation (not guesswork)

---

## Why They Would Pay

### Value Delivered

**Time Savings:**
- From 6 hours → 30 minutes to create a program
- No more second-guessing or manual calculations
- Instant validation feedback

**Quality Assurance:**
- Programs validated against volume landmarks (Israetel/RP guidelines)
- Automatic balance checking (push/pull ratios, muscle group frequency)
- Periodization templates from proven methodologies

**Cost Savings:**
- $10/month vs $150-300/month for a coach
- Get 90% of the value at 5% of the cost
- Learn to program yourself (skill building)

**Confidence:**
- Know your program is scientifically sound
- No more "am I doing too much/too little?"
- Track program quality over time

### Willingness to Pay Indicators

**Comparable spending:**
- Already pay $10-15/month for Strong/Hevy Premium (just for tracking)
- Spend $50-100/month on supplements
- Would pay $200+/month for coaching if they could afford it

**Pain level:**
- Frustrated with stagnation (high emotional cost)
- Know they're leaving gains on the table
- Want autonomy but need structure

**Reference pricing:**
- Notion Pro: $10/month (productivity)
- Spotify: $11/month (entertainment)
- Volym: $10/month (optimize 10+ hours/week training) = obvious ROI
